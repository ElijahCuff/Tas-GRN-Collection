# Tas GRN Collection
Tasmania Australia, Government Radio Network Collection.    
- This project aims to shed light on serious concerns around the Tasmanian Police ( TasPol ) government radio network, most notably that the system is usually covered in it's entirety online through various citizens supplying live scanner feeds directly to the internet.    
- Tas GRN uses an extremely old method of Edacs Trunking, analogue audio is sent over various switching channels in the 800Mhz range, rarely do they use digital audio or encryption.   
- The government initiative to improve the security of the Tas GRN is at a massive cost to the tax payers, several million dollars in handset upgrades are needed, they estimate each secure handset to cost around $1000 and the entire network will not be secure until an estimated 10 years,  possibly never.
