### Universal Police TGID    
‚Ä¢ Some scanners require entering a TGID to listen in on specific Talk Group's, for example the Health Department/Ambulance or Defence Department/Police.   
Many departments have several TGID's to seperate transmissions, for example the Tas GRN has several TGID'S for identifying if it's from a Vehicle, from an officer's device on the field or from a Headquarters such as state wide Broadcast for instance.

The talk groups can be annoying to program on some handsets, üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Uniden I'm looking at you.      
For this reason a useful trick to include all departments is to set your TGID as open after 08...
```
08----
```
This tells the handset to exclude anything that isn't by a police department.
